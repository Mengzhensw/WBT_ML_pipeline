# WBT ML pipeline
This repository contains the code and resources used in the manuscript titled "A Comprehensive Atlas of Peripheral Blood Gene Signatures Across 27 Healthy Conditions."

Whole blood transcriptomics (WBT) offers valuable insights into systemic health and disease. In this study, we present a WBT atlas comprising 2,127 samples across 27 distinct health conditions. We developed a multi-omics classification model to distinguish these conditions based on disease-specific signature genes. The modelâ€™s performance was validated in 11 independent cohorts, totaling 2,674 samples.
The provided code includes two components: (1) the multi-omics classification pipeline applied to our internal dataset, and (2) the validation pipeline used on publicly available datasets. All necessary data for running the pipeline are included in the data folder.
